# GameOnGodot
This is my second game and first game in godot, here is a one-level platformer.

I hope that is not so bad for the first experience in godot.

I have got acquainted with interesting information like parallax background or creating tilemap for creating a level, also I have created some characters and realize
a few base mechnics.
